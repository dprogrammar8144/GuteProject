Lesson 2 :Technical Understanding and Requirements.

2.1	Database Management System
First we need to understand what a database is and such we can now lay more emphasis other related area relationg to database.
A database is stored as a file or a set of files on magnetic disk or tape, optical disk, or some other secondary storage device. The information in these files may be broken down into records, each of which consists of one or more fields. Fields are the basic units of data storage, and each field typically contains information pertaining to one aspect or attribute of the entity described by the database. Records are also organized into tables that include information about relationships between its various fields. Although database is applied loosely to any collection of information in computer files, a database in the strict sense provides cross-referencing capabilities. Using keywords and various sorting commands, users can rapidly search, rearrange, group, and select the fields in many records to retrieve or create reports on particular aggregates of data.

Type of Databases
We have 11 types of databases and they are listed as follows:
1.	Centralized Database
2.	Distributed Database.
3.	Personal Database.
4.	End-user Database.
5.	Commercial Data base.
6.	NoSQL Database.
7.	Operational Database.
8.	Relational Database.
9.	Cloud Database.
10.	Object-Oriented Database
11.	Graph Database.

Brief Expalanation on the  Database types.
1.	Centralized Database:The information(data) is stored at a centralized location and the users from different locations can access this data. This type of database contains application procedures that help the users to access the data even from a remote location.
2.	Distributed Database: Just opposite of the centralized database concept, the distributed database has contributions from the common database as well as the information captured by local computers also. The data is not at one place and is distributed at various sites of an organization. These sites are connected to each other with the help of communication links which helps them to access the distributed data easily.
 
Typical Example of a Distributed Database.

3.	Personal Database:Data is collected and stored on personal computers which is small and easily manageable. The data is generally used by the same department of an organization and is accessed by a small group of people.
4.	End User Database: The end user is usually not concerned about the transaction or operations done at various levels and is only aware of the product which may be a software or an application. Therefore, this is a shared database which is specifically designed for the end user, just like different levels’ managers. Summary of whole information is collected in this database.
5.	Commercial Database:These are the paid versions of the huge databases designed uniquely for the users who want to access the information for help. These databases are subject specific, and one cannot afford to maintain such a huge information. Access to such databases is provided through commercial links.
6.	NoSQL Database : These are used for large sets of distributed data. There are some big data performance issues which are effectively handled by relational databases, such kind of issues are easily managed by NoSQL databases. There are very efficient in analyzing large size unstructured data that may be stored at multiple virtual servers of the cloud.
7.	Operational Database: Information related to operations of an enterprise is stored inside this database. Functional lines like marketing, employee relations, customer service etc. require such kind of databases.
8.	Relational Database: These databases are categorized by a set of tables where data gets fit into a pre-defined category. The table consists of rows and columns where the column has an entry for data for a specific category and rows contains instance for that data defined according to the category. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard user and application program interface for a relational database.
9.	Cloud Databases :A cloud database is a database that has been optimized or built for such a virtualized environment. There are various benefits of a cloud database, some of which are the ability to pay for storage capacity and bandwidth on a per-user basis, and they provide scalability on demand, along with high availability.
10.	Object-Oriented Databases: An object-oriented database is a collection of object-oriented programming and relational database, An object-oriented database is organized around objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic.
11.	Graph Databases: The graph is a collection of nodes and edges where each node is used to represent an entity and each edge describes the relationship between entities. A graph-oriented database, or graph database, is a type of NoSQL database that uses graph theory to store, map and query relationships.

Database Configuration will be done practically in class for student to get hand of how database is configure and setup$ basic script will be exposed to the students in class.
Also table structures will be discussed and shown in class.

MPR - Management Performance Reporting 
22/04/2021
	Data Retention Policy (this is done to avert slow loading of the system in generating a report due to heavy database that have accumulated in the bank central database over a time period) - every bank does this, when the bank database became so large they then pick the total balances of entries from all GLs from the central database and deposit it into another database. those balances are taken from all the general ledgers covering a period of time, say 2000-2019. 
Scenario - let's say the total balances from all the GLs are 1Million, the amount then is credited as opening balance in the year 2019. (Update and Truncate are two kinds of scripts that are very delicate - must be appropriately checked before running)
	Not On Us Transaction - it is a kind of transaction that are being performed from other channels other than directly from the bank e.g. POS.

Mortgage bank and financial bank
Mortgage bank: they accept cash
Finance house: they don’t accept cash, they give loan and investment and they don’t take cash. They only take from their corresponding bank. They give out housing .
Enumerations offer an easy way to work with sets of related constants. An enumeration, or Enum , is a symbolic name for a set of values. Enumerations are treated as data types, and you can use them to create sets of constants for use with variables and properties.20 Jul 2015
In computer programming, an enumerated type (also called enumeration, enum, or factor in the R programming language, and a categorical variable in statistics) is a data type consisting of a set of named values called elements, members, enumeral, or enumerators of the type.
Data retention policy: What is a data retention policy? A data retention policy is a set of guidelines that helps organisations keep track of how long information must be kept and how to dispose of the information when it's no longer needed. The policy should also outline the purpose for processing the personal data

NotOnUs: transaction done outside the banking system.
The ledger balance is the opening balance in the bank account the next morning and remains the same all day. The ledger balance is also often referred to as the current balance and is different than the available balance in an account.
Ledge bal is a component of the money you are expecting in that balance and what you have in your available balance.

Question: schedule method involves in loan process
(e.g schedule and frequency method)

Different schedule Method:

1.	Straight line method
Straight line basis is a method of calculating depreciation and amortization, the process of expensing an asset over a longer period of time than when it was purchased. It is calculated by dividing the difference between an asset's cost and its expected salvage value by the number of years it is expected to be used.

2.	School schedule 

3.	Reducing balance 
4.	The reducing balance method of depreciation results in declining depreciation expenses with each accounting period. In other words, it charges depreciation at a higher rate in the earlier years of an asset.
Reducing balance depreciation is a method of calculating depreciation whereby an asset is expensed at a set percentage. ... In other words, more depreciation is charged at the beginning of an asset's lifetime and less is charged towards the end.
5.	Fixed amount per month
A fixed-rate payment is an installment loan with an interest rate that cannot be changed during the life of the loan. The payment amount also will remain the same, though the proportions that go toward paying off the interest and paying off the principal will vary.

6.	Annuity 
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company in which you make a lump-sum payment or series of payments and, in return, receive regular disbursements, beginning either immediately or at some point in the future

7.	Fixed total repayment 
In a fixed-rate payment, the total amount due remains the same throughout the life of the loan, although the proportion that goes to interest and principal varies. The fixed-rate payment most often refers to mortgage loans. The borrower must decide between a fixed-rate payment and an adjustable-rate payment.

8.	Staggered payment 
Making staggered payments allows a customer to purchase a high-priced item without having to lay out all the cash at once.

Staggered payment is an option under a term plan wherein the nominees receive a portion of the sum assured as a lump sum and the remaining money comes in form of monthly or annual payments. The duration of the payments varies from policy to policy.

A moratorium period is the time during a loan term when the borrower is not required to make any repayment. ... Normally, the repayment begins after the loan is disbursed and the payments have to be made every month. However, due to the moratorium period, the payment starts after some time
How does a moratorium loan work?
Borrowers who had opted for the loan moratorium were not required to pay EMIs during that period. During the moratorium period, the interest is not waived off and will continue to accrue on the outstanding amount. Further, individuals have to pay additional interest on the months for which the EMI moratorium was taken

If no interest and principal in the third or fourth month in moratorium loan, the interest for the 3 outstanding month will be added up in total in the 5th month.
